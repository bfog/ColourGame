A colour guessing game based on rgb

This was created with some simple JavaScript and CSS.

## How To Play
1. You will be given a random rgb value in the title. Try to guess its colour.
2. Click on a square to choose a colour.
3. If the chosen colour is correct, all the other squares will change to match it.
4. Wrong choices will cause the square to disappear. 
5. You can change the difficulty between easy and hard.
